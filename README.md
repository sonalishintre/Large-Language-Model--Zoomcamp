Large Language Model (LLM)
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. These models are typically based on deep learning architectures, such as the Transformer, and are capable of tasks like text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, and much more.

Key features of LLMs include:

Pre-trained on large datasets: LLMs are trained on extensive corpora of text, which allows them to learn the nuances, syntax, and semantics of human language.
Versatility: They can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis, content generation, or even code generation.
Contextual understanding: LLMs generate responses based on the context of the input, making them highly adaptive to different types of queries.
Common LLMs include models like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and others that are widely used for natural language processing (NLP) applications.
